. Add System.map loading and backtrace support (with function names)
_ Add initial SFI table support.
  - These are what replaced (much earlier) MP tables and are available in
    adition to (or instead of) ACPI tables. They start at any 16-byte boundary
    between 0xe0000 and 0xfffff.
  - Use these to inform the kernel of the number of processors. Do _not_ use the
    memory map table, as this is already implemented by the fake BIOS.
_ Figure out how which address space the APIC will live in and make it available
  - If it's in the MSRs, add callback support for these to QSim.

  _ Old-style interrupt controller
